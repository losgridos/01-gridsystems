# gridsystems

Grid Systems is part of my personal project Los Gridos, where I just create a different landing page using the power of CSS Grids. This is just a personal project where I can play and test the limits of CSS Grids. 

The design of the page is the cover of the classic book of Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann book Grid Systems / Raster Systeme. 

For the code organization I followed the principles of the ITCSS architecture.
