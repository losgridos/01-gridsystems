# Grid Systems: a CSS Grid experiment
Grid Systems is a personal project where I play and test the limits of CSS Grids. 

The design of the page is the cover of the classic book of Josef Müller-Brockmann book Grid Systems / Raster Systeme. 

For the code organization I followed the principles of the ITCSS architecture.

## Description 
Grid Systems is a landing play where I can experiment with the CSS Grid. The design of the site is the cover of the classic book of Josef Müller-Brockmann book Grid Systems / Raster Systeme. I thought it is the perfect motive to play with the grid. 
For the code organization I followed the principles of the ITCSS architecture.  

## Motivation
This project was created by myself with the intention of getting better at the understanding and use of the CSS Grid. As a front-end developer, a very important skill is being able to create a dynamic and responsive layout system. 

#### Project Goals: 
1) Learn how exactly work CSS Grids. 
2) Test the limits of the CSS Grid, how exactly work and what can you build with it. 
3) Learn how it work and implement a code architecture following the ITCSS principles. 

#### About the UX/UI Design
The goal of this project was not to develop a great UI/UX design, just to focus on coding. But as a designer myself, I needed at least a minimun viable UX to pleased my eyes while coding. I didn´t designed everything from scratch, but got inspiration from the old medium.com landing site.
