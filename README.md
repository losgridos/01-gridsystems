# Grid Systems: a CSS Grid experiment
Grid Systems is a personal project where I play and test the limits of CSS Grids. 

The design of the page is the cover of the classic book of Josef Müller-Brockmann book Grid Systems / Raster Systeme. 

For the code organization I followed the principles of the ITCSS architecture.

## Description 
Grid Systems is a landing play where I can experiment with the CSS Grid. The design of the site is the cover of the classic book of Josef Müller-Brockmann book Grid Systems / Raster Systeme. I thought it is the perfect motive to play with the grid. 
For the code organization I followed the principles of the ITCSS architecture.  

## Motivation
This project was created by myself with the intention of getting better at the understanding and use of the CSS Grid. As a front-end developer, a very important skill is being able to create a dynamic and responsive layout system. 

#### Project Goals:

2) Test the limits of the CSS Grid, how exactly work and what can you build with it. 
3) Learn how it work and implement a code architecture following the ITCSS principles.
